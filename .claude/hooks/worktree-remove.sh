# WorktreeRemove hook: when Claude Code removes a worktree (session exit, a finished
# subagent, a deleted background session), stop that worktree's Docker stack and delete
# its volumes first. Claude Code only cleans up the git side. A manual
# `git worktree remove` doesn't fire this — /raa-finish runs script/worktree-down itself.
# Never blocks the removal: a stack that couldn't be stopped shows up later as an orphan
# in the session-start line (script/docker-sweep).
